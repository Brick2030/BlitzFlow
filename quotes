(C) Friedrich Nietzsche$
When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.

Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman, a rope over an abyss... What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end: what can be loved in man is that he is an overture and a going under$

The man of knowledge must be ablt not only to love his enemies, but also to hate his friends$

He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying$

You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.$

The higher we soar the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly.$

Few are made for independence, it is the privilege of the strong.$

Do you want to have an easy life? Then always stay with the herd and lose yourself in the herd.$

No price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.$

The tree that would grow to heaven must send its roots to hell.$

There are no facts, only interpretations.$

I and me are always too deeply in conversation.$

Love your enemies because they bring out the best in you.$

So long as men praise you, you can only be sure that you are not yet on your own true path but on someone else's.$

They muddy the water, to make it seem deep.$

One should die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly.

#(C) Hermann Hesse$

To achieve the possible, we must attempt the impossible again and again.$

Love your suffering. Do not resist it, do not flee from it. It is only your aversion to it that hurts, nothing else.$

Whoever wants music instead of noise, joy instead of pleasure, soul instead of gold, creative work instead of business, passion instead of foolery, finds no home in this trivial world of ours.$

The true profession of a man is to find his way to himself.$

Learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest.$

God does not send us despair in order to kill us; he sends it in order to awaken us to new life.$

There is no reality except the one contained within us.$

The deity is within you, not in ideas and books. Truth is lived, not taught.$

You can ride, you can travel with a friend of your own;*
The final step you must take alone.*
No wisdom is better than this when known:*
That every hard thing is done alone.$

Loneliness is the way by which destiny endeavors to lead man to himself.$

And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.

Sometimes when you're writing a poem - or a story - your brain gets too fixated on a specific point... If you try so hard to make it perfect, then you'll never make any progress. Just force yourself to get something down on the paper, and tidy it up later! Another way to think about it is this: If you keep your pen in the same spot for too long, you'll just get a big dark puddle of ink. So just move your hand, and go with the flow!
